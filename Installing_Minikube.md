# 1.What is a Minikube? 
Taken from official k8s documentation [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/), Minikube is

> "a tool that runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster in a virtual machine on your laptop."

# 2.To-do in one list...
You need: 
1. A Hyperviser 
2. Kubectl
3. Minikube 

# 3.Issues Resovled today when setting up on MacOS
## 3.1 Hyperviser: Oracle Virtual Box:
Installation through an error without specifying reasons. It turned out that Mac blocked it from installing and you can refer to [this](https://medium.com/@DMeechan/fixing-the-installation-failed-virtualbox-error-on-mac-high-sierra-7c421362b5b5) post to have it resolved.

## 3.2 Kubectl
We should be all good!
## 3.3 Minikube
We should be all good! Test out with simple operations [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/)
